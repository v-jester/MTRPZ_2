**Lay** me down to rest

On the hilltop **high**

In the _fields_ so **vast**

Under _skies_ wide and blue,

Where the **valleys**, and the peaks

Can be seen, can be felt,

As the wind whispers softly.

---

When the rivers carry

To the _endless_ ocean

The **tears of sorrow**... then

Shall I leave the **plains** and valleys â€”

Leave all behind, and _soar*_

To the **heavens** above

To find peace... but until then

I wander in the dark.

`Lay` me down, but then rise,

Break the shackles

And with **courageous hearts**

Forge the path to freedom.

---

And in the big family,

In the family free and new,

**Remember me always**

With a gentle, kind word.
